Welcome to the cml-syntax wiki!

This wiki is intended to track the state of CML grammar as it is
implemented in the tool.  It's still a little rough at the moment, but
we're working on it.  Contact Joey (<jwc@iha.dk>) if you have questions
or want to be added to the editing team.

Sections:
* Toplevel bits: the top abstraction [[CML Model|model]] and contained [[Declarations|declaration]]
* [[Processes|process]] and the syntax for [[chanset/nameset expressions|varset]]
* [[Actions|action]] and [[Statements|statement]]
* [[Operation|operation]] declarations
* [[Expressions|expression]], [[Function|function]] declarations, and [[Patterns|pattern]]
* [[Types|type]]
