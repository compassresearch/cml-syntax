Welcome to the cml-syntax wiki!

This wiki is intended to track the state of CML grammar as it is
implemented in the tool.  It's still a little rough at the moment, but
we're working on it.  Contact Joey (<jwc@iha.dk>) if you have questions
or want to be added to the editing team.

The grammar itself is in the [[CMLGrammar]] page.
